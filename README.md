# Clue

This repo contains a collection of self contained modules that can be used to interact
with the Adafriut CLUE sensor board.

## Setup

In a virtual environment run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then each individual module has it own `setup.sh` script to configure the CLUE for the
various tasks.
